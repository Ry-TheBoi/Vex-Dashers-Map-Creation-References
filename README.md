# Vex-Dashers-Map-Creation-References
This repository is used for the intent of referencing resource materials on how to make a Vex Dashers map
(Version Compatibilities: 2.01 - 2.07)

The file "MapData.lua" is a Roblox lua module that the game uses to set up the map for Vex Dashers gameplay. Instructions of how to set up MapData are included in the Roblox model kit. This repository exist as a blank reference to the Vex Dashers map resources materials if in any case map developers (or even I when I'm stupid) need to reference back these materials or lose some of these materials.
